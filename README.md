# Analysis-of-World-s-Leading-Risk-Factors-For-Deaths-Visualization-Project
As per the World Health Organization, approximately 60 â€“ 85 percent of people around the globe lead inactive lifestyles that contribute to their health issues. The leading causes of death across the world still vary significantly, it is crucial to understand the causes that lead to death and the risk factors related to a precipitous death. The aim of this project is to analyze the data and find patterns in the deaths caused due to various risk factors. We believe this project would help the governments and organizations to focus on better policy making and targeted spending on health care.
